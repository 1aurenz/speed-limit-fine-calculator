# speed-limit-fine-calculator

You are running a transportation company, and your negligent drivers exceed the speed limit over and over again.

Every time you want to find out how much you will pay for their mistakes, you have to google the speed limits and the fines. You decided to create a console app that asks the vehicle type, the road type, and the speed of the vehicle, and calculates the ticket.

We have three types of vehicles: car, bus and truck. The speed limit values are the following (in km/h):
Vehicle Type 	Urban Areas 	Main Roads 	Highways
Cars 	50 	90 	130
Buses 	50 	70 	100
Trucks 	50 	70 	80

When developing the app, please keep in mind the architectural principles you've acquired in the Basic Architecture section of this chapter. Your application should:

    satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle,
    use the Interface Segregation Principle,
    use Dependency Injection,
    include logging of the operations,
    follow Clean Code Principles.

The interfaces have been provided in the starter code. You need to plug in the implementations and make the application work.
